# Student-Score-Prediction
a linear regression model to predict students' exam scores based on their study hours using Python and scikit-learn.
 # Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts student exam scores based on study hours using linear regression.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between study time and exam performance, building a predictive model that can estimate student scores based on hours studied.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about student study habits and exam performance, including:
- Hours_Studied: Number of hours spent studying
- Exam_Score: Final exam score (0-100)
- Additional features: Attendance, Sleep_Hours, Previous_Scores, etc.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed distributions and relationships between variables
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers
3. **Visualization**: Created scatter plots and histograms to understand data patterns
4. **Model Building**: Implemented linear regression to predict exam scores
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using R², MSE, and RMSE metrics

## Results

The linear regression model achieved:
- R² Score: 0.89
- Root Mean Squared Error: 4.23
- Strong positive correlation between study hours and exam scores
